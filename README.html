	<h1 style="letter-spacing:0.1em;">Durden - The large image tiler</h1>
	<h2 style="letter-spacing:0.1em">What is Durden?</h2>
	<p>Durden is a command line program that will take a large image, and create the tiles necessary for the image to be viewed using various client software such as the Bigimage Google map image viewer.</p>
	<p>Durden creates a number of directories (depending on the size of the image).  These are numbered from 0 up.  These folders represent the different zoom levels at which an image can be viewed.  Zoom level 0 contains one image, 1 contains 4, 2 contains 16 and so on (2^(2*zoomlevel)).</p>
	<h2 style="letter-spacing:0.1em">Install/Compile</h2>
	<p>Compilation is pretty simple.  Firstly, you must ensure you have the ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick if you prefer, although I have not yet tested this) development libraries installed.  On a Debian based machine, this is as simple as running:</p>
	<pre style="border:solid 1px black; padding:10px;margin:0;color:black;background-color:#f5f5b5">$ apt-get install libmagick++-dev</pre>
	<p>Next simply run the compile script included.  This should create the "durden" executable.  If you have any issues, please post them to me, and I will attempt to help.</p>
	<pre style="border:solid 1px black; padding:10px;margin:0;color:black;background-color:#f5f5b5">$ ./compile</pre>
	<p>Assuming the binary file has been created, you should now copy it to somewhere in your path, e.g. ~/bin or /usr/local/bin.</p>
	<pre style="border:solid 1px black; padding:10px;margin:0;color:black;background-color:#f5f5b5">$ sudo cp durden /usr/local/bin</pre>
	<h2 style="letter-spacing:0.1em">Usage</h2>
	<p>Durden accepts two or three command line arguments.  The first is the filename of an image, the second is a folder to output the tiles to (the folder will be created if it does not already exist), and the final optional argument is a tile size.  The default tile size is 256x256 pixels - as supported by the Google Maps API.</p>
	<p>The example below will read in the image "image.tiff" and create a folder "output" into which a number of sub-folders will be created.  The number of sub-folders that are created will depend on the size of image.tiff.</p>
	<pre style="border:solid 1px black; padding:10px;margin:0;color:black;background-color:#f5f5b5">$ durden image.tiff output</pre>
	<h2 style="letter-spacing:0.1em">Support</h2>
	<p>Support requests should be posted to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/bigimage?categories=All">Big Image issues queue</a>, ensuring you specify "Durden" as the component.  Unfortunately you will need a Drupal.org account before you can post a support request/bug report.</p>
	<h2 style="letter-spacing:0.1em">Durden?</h2>
	<p>The name Durden is a reference to the character Tyler Durden in the book/film "Fight Club".  This software is an image tiler and is also "...free in all the ways that you are not."</p>
